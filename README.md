# Serverless Plugin Carbonless

Copy lambdas to other regions and run your code where the carbon intensity is lowest. On average reduces carbon emissions of serverless applications by 53% compared to using the default region.

## Usage

Coming soon to **npm**

In this repository I have included a 'hello world' carbonless application, the first serverless application I deployed using the Carbonless plugin. The plugin is used locally. You can deploy this carbonless application in your own AWS environment as you would any other serverless application using the Serverless Framework. See how it copies lambdas to other regions and how the 'carbonless router' lambda routes requests to the the region with the lowest carbon intensity.
